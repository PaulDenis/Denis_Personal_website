                    <h2>Full name:</h2>
                    <p>Paul Denis-Ionut</p>
                    <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Romania but i live in Italy now.</p>
                    <h2>Passions:</h2>
                    <p>I love to play video games, but I was always interested in coding. I created a few games, but soon I discovered that was not as interesting as playing them. That's why I learned how to be a <span>Web Developer</span>, and now I'm here I also like to create youtube content and try to make people interested in programming, since it's such an amazing world and the world need programmers.</p>
                    <h2>Where did you learn to code?</h2>
                    <p>I first started at school, with some basic C++. Then at first year of university, again with C++ and some Java. When I gave up university I bought a course in Udemy to learn how to code games on Unity using C#. In the end I found this course named <a href="https://www.boolean.careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="boolean">Boolean Careers</a> that teached me how to be a professional Web-Developer, and they did an amazing job! </p>
                    <h2>How would you describe yourself as a worker?</h2>
                    <p>I am very dedicated to my job and I do it with passion. More importnat, I always put my 100% in everything I do, even when I don't like what I am doing. I can also put pride aside and tell that I am not skilled enough for the job, because I don't want someone to come to me for a web-page and to go away with a bad product and having to do it all over again. I care about my costumers and I want them to be happy about their page.</p>
